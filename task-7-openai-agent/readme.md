# Task 07 – Smart Agent Using OpenAI SDK 

Overview

Welcome to the OpenAI Agents SDK Project! This repository is your complete guide to building intelligent AI assistants using the OpenAI Agents SDK. Whether you're just beginning your coding journey or already an experienced developer, this project will help you create AI agents that can answer questions, manage tasks, provide recommendations, or even assist with homework. 

It’s like giving your computer a smart, helpful brain of its own!

## What is the OpenAI Agents SDK?

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a powerful Python library that enables you to build intelligent AI agents — like virtual assistants that can perform real-world tasks. Originally evolved from the “Swarm” project, it’s now open-source and completely free to use and customize.

With this SDK, you can create AI agents that can:

- 🤖 Answer questions like: “What’s a healthy snack?”
- 📝 Assist with planning, like creating a workout routine or a study schedule.
- 🤝 Collaborate as a team of agents to tackle complex tasks together.

This project demonstrates how to build a smart AI agent using OpenAI's assistant structure with custom logic and reusability.

## Run Steps
1. Clone this repo
2. Add your API key in `.env`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python app.py`

## File Structure
- agent.py – Agent schema (title, behavior, model)
- runner.py – Logic to run the agent
- app.py – Entry point (create + run agent)
