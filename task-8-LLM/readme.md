   LLMs are trained using **billions of words** from books, websites, articles, and conversations.

2. **Learning Patterns**:  
   The model learns **how people write and speak**, and what words usually come together.

3. **Understanding Context**:  
   It doesn’t just look at one word — it understands the **whole sentence** and **responds smartly**.

4. **Generating Responses**:  
   Based on what you ask, it creates replies that sound **natural and meaningful**.
